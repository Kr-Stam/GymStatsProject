## Introduction
To open file, set gradle settings to Java 11

This is a copy of the strong android app.
Multiple plugins are used, material design for making a bottom sheet, room for databases, dependency injection with Hilt, charts from MPAndroidChart,
live data and sectioned recyclerview.

The application is fragment based, each fragment is loaded into the Main Actitivity container. 
There are also seperate activities for detail popup views. 
MVVM architecture is used, each fragment and activity has its own view model. Everything is almost fully functional
with the exception of the graphs which are partially built but have no database.
